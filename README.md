# Simple PHP frontend for e-shop
Author: David Salac <http://www.github.com/david-salac>

This is a demonstration of the plain PHP page (using PHP in version 7.x).
I represent simple e-shop with primitive products (in this case, inks).
The aim of this demonstration is to show that plain PHP can still be
successfully used for these purposes.
