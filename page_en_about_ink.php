    <strong>High quality waterproof inks for fountain pen.</strong>

    <p id="navInkAdvantage">ANNELLA inks are high quality waterproof pigment inks. The waterproof means that ink does not dissolve or loosing color in the water (with is common for other water based inks). The other benefit of ANNELLA inks is pH neutral composition. That basically means that inks does not damage pen by rusting metal parts (in opposite to iron gall inks that does corrode pen). ANNELLA inks is especially useful for short-term using (writing long or important documents and so on). Another benefit of ANNELLA ink is color stability (ink does not change color during the time).</p>

    <h2 id="navUseOfInk">Other information</h2>
    <p>It is highly recommended to using ANNELLA inks in short-term only. We does not recommend using inks in relatively expensive pens (or much old ones). If you are writing on thin paper ink could be easily found on the other side of the paper. You should be careful not to stain cloth by ink (it could irrecoverably demage cloth).</p>
